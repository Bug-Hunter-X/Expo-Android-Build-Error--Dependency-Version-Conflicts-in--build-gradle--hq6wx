The solution involves carefully reviewing the `dependencies` block in the `android/app/build.gradle` file and identifying conflicting versions.  This usually involves checking for multiple versions of a single library or inconsistencies between declared versions and those implicitly used by other dependencies. Resolving this often means specifying exact versions to eliminate ambiguity and ensure compatibility. If the conflict involves Expo's core dependencies, it might be necessary to update Expo CLI or investigate compatibility between different Expo packages.  Here's an example of how it might look in `build.gradle.solution`:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1") // Example: specifying an exact version
    // ... other dependencies ...
}
```
In more complex cases, you may need to analyze the dependency tree to discover the root cause of the conflict using the Gradle command `./gradlew app:dependencies` (adjusting the command for your specific project structure). This reveals all the dependencies and their versions, helping pinpoint the conflicting components.
