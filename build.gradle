This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `android/app/build.gradle` file.  Specifically, it might happen when there's a mismatch or conflict in the versions of dependencies declared in the file. The error message itself might not be very clear, mentioning build failures or issues with specific Android libraries or plugins.  The issue isn't easily debugged by simply checking the manifest or package.json because the core problem lies within the gradle configuration itself. It might be triggered by recent updates to Expo Go or the Expo CLI.
